NOTES:
- '~/.path' needs to include '/usr/local/bin' by default.
- Ask to install Python via brew
	- Make sure '/usr/local/share/python' gets added to the path
	- Make sure '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/Extras/lib/python/PyObjC' gets added to the path
- mkdir ~/Applications' && brew linkapps at the very end



wget:

Nginx:
In the interest of allowing you to run `nginx` without `sudo`, the default
port is set to localhost:8080.

If you want to host pages on your local machine to the public, you should
change that to localhost:80, and run `sudo nginx`. You'll need to turn off
any other web servers running port 80, of course.

You can start nginx automatically on login running as your user with:
  mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  cp /usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.2.7/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
  launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist

Though note that if running as your user, the launch agent will fail if you
try to use a port below 1024 (such as http's default of 80.)

To have launchd start nginx at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load nginx now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist
Warning: /usr/local/sbin is not in your PATH
You can amend this by altering your ~/.bashrc file



MySQL:
Set up databases to run AS YOUR USER ACCOUNT with:
    unset TMPDIR
    mysql_install_db --verbose --user=`whoami` --basedir="$(brew --prefix mysql)" --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql --tmpdir=/tmp

To set up base tables in another folder, or use a different user to run
mysqld, view the help for mysql_install_db:
    mysql_install_db --help

and view the MySQL documentation:
  * http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql-install-db.html
  * http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/default-privileges.html

To run as, for instance, user "mysql", you may need to `sudo`:
    sudo mysql_install_db ...options...

A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
server starting up correctly.

To connect:
    mysql -uroot

To have launchd start mysql at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load mysql now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    mysql.server start



Memcached:
To have launchd start memcached at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/memcached/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load memcached now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.memcached.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    /usr/local/opt/memcached/bin/memcached
